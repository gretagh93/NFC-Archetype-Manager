# NFC-Archetype-Manager

This commit adds an Arduino sketch that enables reading and writing data on NFC tags using the MFRC522 RFID module. The sketch includes functionality for:

- Initializing the MFRC522 module.
- Authenticating with NFC tags using default or custom keys.
- Reading data from specific blocks on the NFC tag.
- Writing data to specific blocks on the NFC tag.
- Handling errors during communication with the NFC tag.

The code is designed to be easily customizable for different use cases, such as storing and retrieving custom data structures or managing access control systems.

Dependencies:
- MFRC522 library (https://github.com/miguelbalboa/rfid)

Usage:
1. Connect the MFRC522 module to your Arduino board.
2. Upload the sketch to the Arduino.
3. Use the serial monitor to interact with the NFC tag.

This implementation is ideal for projects involving NFC-based data storage, access control, or IoT applications.
